This command activates any EPROMs in a standard QL format which have
been plugged into the ROM port on the Atari ST. The code contained in
the EPROMs is initialised just as it would be on the QL.

**NOTE**

This can only be used on code which is stored on EPROM chips, as a QL
EPROM cartridge cannot be plugged into the Atari ST.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See also :ref:`rom-load` and
:ref:`eprom-load` which allows you to
transport code across from QL EPROM cartridges.
