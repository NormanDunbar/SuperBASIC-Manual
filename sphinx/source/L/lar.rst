LAR loads a file which must have been stored with SAR or SARO
into a dimensioned array. The array must have been initialised with DIM
to the same dimensions of the stored array, and of course the type
(float, integer, string) must be the same. The default data device is
supported.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See :ref:`datad-dlr` about the default data device.
:ref:`sar` and :ref:`saro` are
complementary commands.
