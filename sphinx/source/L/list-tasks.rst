LIST\_TASKS
===========

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Syntax   |  LIST\_TASKS [#ch]                                                |

LIST\_TASKS is nearly the same as JOBS, but the output is slightly
different. Each line written to the specified channel (default #1)
consists of the job name, job number, job tag and priority. A 'w'
appended to the priority indicates that the job is currently suspended.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

:ref:`jobs` is similar.
