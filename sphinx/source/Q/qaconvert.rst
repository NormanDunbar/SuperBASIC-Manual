This command takes a file which is stored on a QL Format disk and
converts it into Atari Format. It will then convert special characters
in that file to Atari compatible characters as well as converting any
occurrence of a Line Feed character CHR$(10) to a Carriage Return
character CHR$(13) followed by a Line Feed character CHR$(10).
