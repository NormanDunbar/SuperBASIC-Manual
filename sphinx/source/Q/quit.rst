This command is used to force remove a Multiple SBASIC Interpreter or a
compiled Job (in the latter case it is the same as STOP).

**NOTE**

If this command is used from SuperBASIC Job 0, it will return an
'Incomplete' error.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See :ref:`mb` and :ref:`sbasic`.
:ref:`close` #0 has the same effect from within
a Multiple SBASIC or MultiBASIC Interpreter
