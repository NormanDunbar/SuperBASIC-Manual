This is a logical function which returns either 1 (true) or 0 (false)
depending on whether or not the command was executed on an Atari
QL-Emulator. Unfortunately, there are some additional keywords only
available on the Emulator, so a portable program which uses these has to
check which system it is running on first.

**NOTE**

This function does not always work!

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

Also see :ref:`qdos-dlr`,
:ref:`atari`, :ref:`ver-dlr`,
:ref:`qram-dlr`, :ref:`wman-dlr`,
:ref:`p-env`. :ref:`machine`
is much more reliable.
