+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Syntax   |  BASIC\_POINTER (offset)                                          |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

This function is exactly the same as BASICP.


**NOTE**

A file called TurboFix\_bin can be used to allow BASIC\_POINTER to
access the Minerva MultiBASIC and SMS SBASIC name tables. Some early
versions of TurboFix\_bin have bugs in it. Beware that not all versions
of this file supports SMS SBASICs.


**CROSS-REFERENCE**

Refer to :ref:`basicp`.
