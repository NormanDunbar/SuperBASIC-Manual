Normally, the Pointer Interface will recognise the cursor keys in the
same way as it recognises the mouse, thus allowing you to move the
pointer around the screen using the keyboard.

You may however prefer that the cursor keys had no effect on the pointer
- the solution is simple - just use the command CKEYOFF.

**NOTE**

There were problems with this command prior to v1.56.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

:ref:`ckeyon` tells the Pointer Interface to
recognise the cursor keys again.
