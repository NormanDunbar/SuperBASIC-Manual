This command is very similar to :ref:`cursen`, with the default window being
#1.

However, you can add an exclamation mark after the channel number. If
this is omitted, then upon execution of this command the chosen window
is automatically selected as the active window (where key input is
directed). Add the exclamation mark to prevent this.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See :ref:`cursor-off`,
:ref:`cursen` and
:ref:`cursor-pct` for more details.
