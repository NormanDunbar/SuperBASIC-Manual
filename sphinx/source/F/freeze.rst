The keys <CTRL><F5> cause the QL to stop working until any further
key (except <CTRL>, <SHIFT>, <ALT> and <CAPSLOCK>), including
<CTRL><F5>, is pressed, which will reactivate the QL.

This keystroke is
generated by some commands to give the user a chance of reading the
output, eg. VIEW, EXTRAS, SXTRAS, WDIR.

FREEZE OFF disables <CTRL><F5>, FREEZE ON re-activates it.

**Example**

::

    FREEZE OFF
    EXTRAS
    FREEZE ON
