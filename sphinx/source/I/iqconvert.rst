This command takes a file which is stored on a QL Format disk and
presumes that it was originally an IBM format file. It will then convert
special characters in that file to QL compatible characters as well as
converting any occurrence of a Carriage Return character (CR) followed by
a Line Feed character (LF) to a single Line Feed character LF.
