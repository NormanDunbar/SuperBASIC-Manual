Keywords Introduction
=====================

The following is a general description of the various commands available
to the SuperBASIC programmer, as provided by Public Domain toolkits, QL
Emulators and SuperBASIC itself.

We have indicated which of the commands are functions (and therefore
must appear in a program in the form):

::

    x = FUNCTION ( parameter )

or: 

::

    IF FUNCTION ( parameter ) = value

and those which are procedures (also known as commands) which must
therefore appear in a program in the form: 

::

    PROCEDURE parameter

    
**NOTE**

Many toolkits insist that you initialise the toolkit before you can use
the various keywords contained in those toolkits. Refer to Section 1.1
for details.
