This is a command which should never be needed. If you unplug the
keyboard from the Atari whilst the machine is switched on (this can ruin
your machine), when you plug it back in, you may find that the mouse
buttons no longer work. This command re-initialises the keyboard driver
so that the mouse buttons will work again!
