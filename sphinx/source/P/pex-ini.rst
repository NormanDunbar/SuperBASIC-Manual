This command initiates PEX and makes it take effect - it may be useful
for example to set up the various programs and the windowing
environment, using PEON and IS\_PTRAP and then to start PEX working at
that stage, by using this command.

**NOTE**

Some toolkits report errors when used alongside PEX and some Qliberated
programs refuse to work.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**
