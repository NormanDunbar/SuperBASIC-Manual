This command sets the THOR's battery backed clock to the current system
time (set with SDATE).

**NOTE**

This is not actually necessary on the THOR XVI as this automatically
alters the battery backed clock when the system clock is altered with
SDATE or ADATE.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

:ref:`sdate` and :ref:`adate`
alter the system clock. :ref:`a-sdate` is similar
on the ST/QL Emulator.
