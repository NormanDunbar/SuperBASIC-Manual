This command is found in versions of SMSQ which do not have the Hotkey
System II built in (most QXL versions of SMSQ). It is used to create the
SBASIC Executable Thing so that you can start SBASIC up from a Hotkey or
by using the EXEC set of commands.

**NOTE**

You must only use this command after the file HOT\_REXT has been loaded,
for example with LRESPR flp1\_HOT\_REXT.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

Please refer to :ref:`ew` and
:ref:`sbasic`. Also see the Appendix on Multiple
BASICs.
