This command is the complementary command to SCR2DIS - it enables the
QL's second screen and is also memorised by the Super Gold Card so that
the second screen will always be available for use by programs.

**NOTE**

In order to make proper use of the second screen, you will still need to
startup Minerva in dual screen mode and use the appropriate MODE
commands. Non-Minerva QLs can still use the second screen by using
various machine code techniques.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See :ref:`scr2dis` for more information.
