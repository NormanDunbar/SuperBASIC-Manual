A lot of the information contained in this manual has been based on the
original documentation provided with the toolkits, some authors having
written extensive manuals. The QL User Guide (an excellent introduction
to programming in general and SuperBASIC), the Toolkit II, SMSQ/E and
Minerva manuals and the documentation of the Public Domain Math Package
must also be explicitly mentioned for their quality. You will seldomly 
- we dare say almost never - find a good program with poor documentation.

Great respect must be paid to Roy Atherton, Stephen Berry, Tony Tebby,
Laurence Reeves and Helmut Aigner.

Simon Goodwin has developed, with the help of readers, many extensions
to SuperBASIC in his popular DIY Toolkit column in the Sinclair QL World
magazine. The bundled extensions are now available from Public Domain
libraries as cardware (please send Simon a postcard if you find the
routines useful). We would like to thank Richard Alexander (formerly of
C.G.H. Services) for providing us with a copy of DIY Toolkit and his
encouraging support. Over the years, the DIY Toolkit series has inspired
many people to write their own public domain toolkits. Simon Goodwin has
also revealed many bugs in the original QL keywords in QL World
articles.

Details on selected items have been received from (in alphabetical

Thanks to Boris Jakubith who allowed the inclusion of his ingenious History Device.

Special mention must also be made of Q Branch and Jochen Merz for their
support in resurrecting this project.

This manual deals with the current versions of SuperBASIC, if you want
to use machine code to extend SuperBASIC further, we highly recommend
the 'QDOS / SMS Reference Manual' available from Jochen Merz software
and Q Branch. The technical details of SuperBASIC are contained in 'QL
SuperBASIC The Definitive Handbook' by Jan Jones, available from Quanta.
