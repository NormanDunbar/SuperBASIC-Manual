This command looks at the specified window channel and swaps over red
and green bits on the display, effectively changing the colours on
screen.

**NOTE 1**

This command will only work on screen resolutions of 512x256 pixels.

**NOTE 2**

This command should not really be used in MODE 8.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

:ref:`w-swop` is exactly the same.
:ref:`recol`, :ref:`set-red`
and :ref:`set-green` also allow you to recolour
a window. Refer to the QL display Appendix.
