QPAC2 uses a Button Frame which is normally situated across the top of
the screen. The command WM sets up the three basic windows #0, #1 and #2
so that there is space for two rows of buttons. At the same time, the
window attributes are reset to the status they would have been in had
you reset the system and pressed <F1> for monitor mode. The current
screen resolution mode is not affected.

**NOTE**

QPAC2 and the Pointer Environment are not necessary to use WM.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

:ref:`wmon` restores the original monitor windows and
:ref:`wtv` the TV mode. Use
:ref:`ink`, :ref:`paper`,
:ref:`border` and :ref:`strip`
to change window attributes.
