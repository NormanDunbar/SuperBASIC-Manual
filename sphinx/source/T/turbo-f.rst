This directive forms part of the EXTERNAL and GLOBAL Turbo directives
and is used to specify the names of FuNctions contained in another
compiled module for a program where that program is loaded as several
linked modules (using LINK\_LOAD) rather than one huge program.

**NOTE**

Before v3.00, this directive was called FUNCTION which caused problems
with installing Turbo Toolkit under Minerva and SMS.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See :ref:`turbo-locstr` and
:ref:`turbo-p` for other directives Refer to
EXTERNAL for more information. Use
:ref:`tk-ver-dlr` to check on the version of TURBO
toolkit.
