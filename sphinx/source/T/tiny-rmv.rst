This command removes most of TinyToolkit's commands.

**NOTE**

You should not really use TINY\_RMV because the extensions are not
removed from the Name List but overwritten with undefined strings.
Depending on the operating system and programming environment it may not
be possible to re-activate TinyToolkit and internal system conflicts are
possible.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

Re-activate the Toolkit with :ref:`tiny-ext`.
