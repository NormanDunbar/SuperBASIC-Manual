The command TTSUS will cause the current job to be suspended for
frames/50 seconds (frames/60 on some QLs), ie. the job will wait at the
TTSUS command for the specified time and then continue with the next
command. It is suggested that TTSUS is used as an alternative to the
PAUSE command (same parameter) because it does not require an open
channel - it's a good idea, but please take into account that pressing a
key will not break the pause generated by TTSUS.
