As with other Toolkits, Toolkit II has to be linked into the computer
(except on the ST/QL Emulator and under SMSQ/E where it is automatically
linked in when the computer is started). This command forces all of the
Toolkit II commands to link themselves into the operating system,
overwriting existing definitions of any commands with the same name.

**NOTE**

TK2\_EXT contains special code to enable Toolkit II commands to be used
on JM (and earlier) ROMs in the same program as the TK2\_EXT command.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**
