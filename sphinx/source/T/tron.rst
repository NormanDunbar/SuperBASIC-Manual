This command is very similar to SSTEP except that it does not wait for
a key to be pressed before each statement is executed.

**NOTE**

Minerva's TRACE Toolkit is quite useful but is still just a simple
demonstration of an extension which has been internally added to the
SuperBASIC code.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See :ref:`troff` and
:ref:`sstep`.
