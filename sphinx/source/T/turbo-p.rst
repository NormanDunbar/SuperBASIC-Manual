This directive forms part of the EXTERNAL and GLOBAL Turbo directives
and is used to specify the names of PROCedures contained in another
compiled module for a program where that program is loaded as several
linked modules (using LINK\_LOAD) rather than one huge program.

**NOTE**

Before version 3.00 of the Turbo Toolkit, this directive was called
PROCEDURE which would cause problems with installing the Turbo Toolkit
under Minerva and SMS.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See :ref:`turbo-locstr` and
:ref:`turbo-f` for other directives Refer to
EXTERNAL for more information. Use
:ref:`tk-ver-dlr` to check on the version of TURBO
toolkit.
