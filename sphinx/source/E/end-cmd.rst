This marks the end of a numberless file of direct commands for use with the MERGE
command. This command should be entered on its own as the last line of the numberless
file. It overcomes the problem explained in NOTE 1 of MERGE.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

Please see :ref:`merge`. :ref:`do`
is also useful for executing such files.
