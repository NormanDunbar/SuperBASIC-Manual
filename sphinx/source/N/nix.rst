Nix is a word from colloquial German and means nothing, which is nearly
what this command does. The command is intended to help multitask Qmon,
a monitor program published by Qjump. When the command is issued, a
dummy job named Qmons Nix-Job is created. If the monitor is started to
examine this job, for example by entering::

    QMON con_,4

(assuming that the dummy job has the job number 4), Qmon can easily be switched on and
off.
