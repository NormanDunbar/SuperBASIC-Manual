Norm, I guess your main motivation here is to update the format of the manual, not to act as an editor and maintainer. However, since you currently are adding new material, now might be the time to correct and augment that material. I dont mean to carp from the sidelines, so please feel free to ignore if you dont find it helpful!

FEX_M Example: jobid = FEX\_M(win1_qmac)

Unfortunate use of jobid, as that is a valid keyword in its own right. Then theres the backslash. Might I suggest:

ID = FEX_M(win1_qmac), or <job id> = FEX_M(win1_qmac), or something?

FEW CROSS-REFERENCE: See EW, EXEC_W, JOBS.

To this should be added QUIT, as QUIT [<return parameter>] is the only real way to return an error (or some other long word message) to FEW(). The QUIT entry would then also need to be updated.


Under WM_XXX there is the following explanation:

"..The items are referenced by a 4-digit hex number (16-bit value) as per the list under the entry for WM_INK, or the decimal number equivalent. These numbers should not be used in standard INK, PAPER and BORDER statements â€“ they are not colour values, merely an index to an entry in a list of colour values. They should be used with the WM_x equivalent commands, which will look up the colour values to be used for the item numbers in the list."

This could be clarifed to say that in the context of the WM_XXX keywords, numbers represent indexes, but those same numbers are, of course, valid colours when used with their non-WM_XXX brethren. As it stands, it looks like one shouldnt use the numbers $200 to $238 (512 to 568) as valid colours. Could be confusing when at first trying to get to grips with palettes!

Of course, WM_BORDER needs a whole chapter of its own.. But that, perhaps, is for the future.

HOT_GETSTUFF$ - You probably meant for the cross referenced keywords to be links, and in UPPER case..
