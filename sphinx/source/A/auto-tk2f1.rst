The Super Gold Card allows you to automatically boot up the machine
whenever it is switched on or reset.

This command enables this auto-booting (starting the machine up in
Monitor mode) and also ensures that Toolkit II is initialised as soon as
the machine is switched on. The status set by this command is remembered
by the Super Gold Card even when the power is disconnected.

**CROSS-REFERENCE**

See also :ref:`auto-dis` and
:ref:`auto-tk2f2`.

:ref:`tk2-ext` is needed to initialise Toolkit II
if this command has not been used.
