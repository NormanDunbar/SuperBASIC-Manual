Due to the enhanced hardware on which the ST/QL Emulator is running, you
may find that as with the QXL, Super Gold Card and Gold Card, some
programs run too quickly. The command A\_SPEED allows you to slow the
Emulator down so that you can use these programs. value must be in the
range 0..7.

0 allows the Emulator to run at full speed, whereas 7 makes it run very
slowly.
