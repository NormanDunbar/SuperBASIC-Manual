This command takes a file which is stored on a QL Format disk and
presumes that it was originally an Atari format file. It will then
convert special characters in that file to QL compatible characters as
well as converting any occurence of a Carriage Return character (CR)
followed by a Line Feed character (LF) to a single Line Feed character
LF.
