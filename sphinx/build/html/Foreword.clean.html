<h1>Original Foreword<a class="headerlink" href="#original-foreword" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We first met Rich Mellor at the QL Club International meeting in the
Midlands in 1995. I had read a lot of the articles and reviews that he
had published in the, now defunct, QL World and, as is usual when you
know someone through the written word alone, I was unprepared for the
man that I met.</p>
<p>It was not until I took down his name and address when he bought some
software from us that I found out who this young and enthusiastic QLer
was. During the course of the day he sat down with and discussed the
Flashback database system which Steve Hall had been running under
SMSQ/E. We were trying to get this program adapted to run properly under
SMSQ/E and Rich offered to help do that. He proved to be a formidable
associate. Having once set a target in his sights he nagged away at it
until he achieved his purpose and in the course of doing that uncovered
a numbers of bugs and inconsistencies in the behaviour of SMSQ/E.</p>
<p>Since we received very little co-operation from the Flashback side of
things we have, sadly been unable to bring the product back onto the
market place. In the meantime, Rich has managed to vastly improve the
program and now sells this new version as an upgrade to the original
Flashback SE program.</p>
<p>About twelve months after meeting Rich, we were offered a route finding
program written in Atari Basic. We passed the project to Rich who
attacked it with his usual vigour and soon was assaulting us with disks
of Beta versions. Q-Route was born in 1997 and has proved a very popular
program, with the latest version making use of the Extended Colour
Drivers available under the latest versions of SMSQ/E.</p>
<p>It was at this point that he first mentioned this book. The bulk of the
work here is his, although there have been contributions in the past
from Franz Hermann and Peter Jaeger (both of whom have given their kind
permission for the work to be published). It became obvious as I was
printing this that we could not do it all in one volume and also that we
had to provide it in loose leaf form, instead of as a bound book, so
that we could easily provide updates as they become necessary.</p>
<p>The book arrived at the QBranch Headquarters on floppy disks and my
EPSON printer worked overtime printing the final version. It was
produced entirely using QL Software and Hardware. The copy was generated
in Text 87 plus4 on a Minerva QL / Super Gold Card running under SMSQ/E.
The final copy here was printed on an Aurora / Super Gold Card /
SuperHermes / RomDisq machine to either an EPSON Stylus 200 Inkjet or an
EPSON Stylus 850 Inkjet printer and the result passed to a local
printers to produce the copy that you now hold. I hope that you will
find this useful and informative and that it will inspire you to produce
some elegant programming for the QDOS / SMSQ community.</p>
<p>Since producing the original version of this Manual, Rich has released
Q-Help together with a broad range of other software under the guise of
RWAP Services. Q-Help provides the basic detail of all of the keywords
covered in this book, together with their syntax in an easy to use
program. This can be linked with the Q-Index program which is supplied
with this book to form the ultimate cross-reference guide to the QL&#8217;s
BASIC. Q-Help forms a welcome companion to this manual and is especially
useful if you are travelling. The Sinclair Spectrum is now enjoying
something of a revival, following the re-release of its games for use
with the Amstrad <a class="reference external" href="mailto:E-m&#37;&#52;&#48;iler">E-m<span>&#64;</span>iler</a> phone. The future of the QL is also looking
increasingly rosy (well at least colourwise), since the release of
SMSQ/E v2.98+ which supports up to 16 million colours on the Q40, QXL
and QPC2 systems. The day when the QL can access the internet and email
is also now at hand. We hope that this will keep people more interested
in the QL and its software.</p>
<p>We shall attempt to keep the manual up to date as much as possible with
current developments in the QL world, as new emulators and QL
compatibles are released. If you have any further information which you
feel should appear in this Manual, then please let us have full details
in order that it may be of benefit to the whole QL community.</p>
<p>I am sure we will hear more of Rich Mellor in the future.</p>

<h2>2015 Foreword<a class="headerlink" href="#foreword" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the above Foreword was written, the SBASIC/SuperBASIC Reference
Manual has been enhanced through 4 different update releases, and proved
a best seller despite the 2 large A4 volumes with over 1000 pages of
information on the QL and its SuperBASIC.</p>
<p>Since then, the Manual was re-relased in PDF format and has now, in
recognition of the 30th Anniversary of the launch of the Sinclair QL,
been converted to HTML and put onto the internet to be updated as a QL
Community Project.</p>
<p>I still continue to support the Sinclair QL, its emulators and clones,
ensuring a constant supply of parts and second hand items through my own
website <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk">www.rwapsoftware.co.uk</a> and
through my own retro and vintage computer trading website
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sellmyretro.com">www.sellmyretro.com</a></p>
<p>The manual appears here in all its glory, with the bulk of the
conversion having been automated, but awaiting community input to
improve the layout and add new entries to the Manual.</p>

<h2>Online Edition Foreword<a class="headerlink" href="#online-edition-foreword" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When Rich put the HTML version online and asked for volunteers to tidy it up,
maintain it etc, lots of people <em>didn&#8217;t</em> step forward! I was one of the ones who did
and spent many a happy lunch hour downloading pages, stripping out the invalid HTML,
adding paragraph tags, converting listings to the correct format etc etc. The results
were uploaded by Rich and a nicer, or at least, tidier, version began to take place.</p>
<p>This colourful version is the result of some <em>playing</em> with a product called <strong>Sphinx-doc</strong>
on my Linux box. It takes files in the format of Restructured Text - basically, a plain text
file containg your data and markup commands - and from those, builds all sorts of output
such as epub, pdf and the HTML you are reading right now.</p>
<p>I hope you like it. It takes a long time to get it just right.</p>
